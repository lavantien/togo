a user?
	username
	dailyCap
	dailyQuantity

	> createUser
	> viewUsers
	> loginUser
	> updateUserDailyQuantity

	> createTask
	> listTasks
	(> editTaskByName)
	(> deleteTaskByName)
	> countTasksCreatedToday

a task?
	id
	name - unique per owner
	content
	owner
	quantity

problem?
	a user create some tasks, the number of tasks must be within the user's dailyCap

logic?
	which user?
	provide task name
	provide task content
	how to check for new day to reset count?
	check if dailyQuantity+1 > dailyCap?
			return 403 Fobbiden - "daily limit exceed"
		else
			if dailyQuantity != countTasksCreatedToday()?
				dailyQuantity=0
			dailyQuantity++
			updateUserDailyQuantity()
			return 201 Created
	fraud protection?
		tasks are not really deleted, they only marked as deleted but retains creation day, so we can count based on that day

params:
	username
	name
	content

result:
	user
	task
